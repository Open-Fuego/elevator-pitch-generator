  <!--Hello digital composer! Welcome to my Elevator Pitch Generator web design tool, powered by Stasis Theory. I'm glad you found it--we're going to adapt a 2,000 year old formula to explain what you want specifically, why it's important, and what where you are going. I use this document in my Technical Communications classes at the University of Pittsburgh to teach my students a little bit about rhetoric, and a little bit about computer science. Just follow along and with comments like this, and you will make a really cool web documemt that helps pitch your idea.

You could make web presentations the easy way, or you can do a little more unconcealing...not just unconcealing who you are, but by opening these tools that you use everyday, these digital/rhetorical tools you might not fully understand, nor know how they function, yet which prove so necessary to how you (re)present yourself and connect with others in virtual spaces. And this last bit is an important point! If we really want to be makers, if we really want to be creative, then we need to understand our tools and how they work. So let's cut it all open--using "tmesis" as the Ancient Greeks would call it--lets "cut" and arrange, tweak, examine, remove and augment...that's how we get making!

In this doc., you will work through the four questions of stasis: conjecture, definition, quality, and policy. This method is tried and true, 100% guaranteed to help you say something meaningful about almost anything. While the Greeks used it to help them explore questions and issues, the design can easily be adapted to other ends like this one. You should commit this exercise of stasis to memory. That way, if you are ever stuck on an elevator with someone important...you'll be ready to have something to say. Yes, I hear the old elevator pitch finds its roots in ancient Greece, way back with the designs of Archimedes, who built the first elevator in 236BC. This new technology caused numerous communication problems for those who found themselves stuck ascending and descending along with important people. For almost two hundred years, the Greeks had no idea what to say to one another until the rhetorician Hermagoras solved this communication problem by developing the questions of stasis. In truth, it was Aristotle, some hundred years pre-elevator, who first theorized the elevator pitch. And much later in the Roman period, Cicero, Quintillian, and Hermogenes added their own iterations.

I like to think about stasis theory in terms of space. Some say the goal of this exercise is stasis, or agreement with the other, but I would argue that the goal os stasis theory is actually movement. Yes, when we come to stasis, we stop. But we stop onlyt long enough to assess how we got where we are and what happened. I argue that we actually use stasis theory to ready ourselves and others to move with changed velocity (in a new direction and perhaps at a different speed.)

 <!--To get started with the Elevator Pitch Generator, you will need to fork my repository from GitHub if you haven't already. If you want to easily publish it on GitHub, I'll give you more information at the end of this document. But for right now, fork, and then download the website to a zip file. Go ahead and put these files in a secure place (folder) where you will be able to find them and organize your other assests like images and pdf's, etcetera. You will also need a text editor like "brackets.io" or "notepad-plus-plus.org." Open the style.css and index.html documents in the text editor and we can get started building our stasis theory web document.-->

  <!--If you are working in groups on GitHub, one group member will need to fork the website in GitHub and then each group members should fork from this new repository.-->

  <!--BTW. You can leave these faded comments be, or delete them. They are but road signs, absent from the larger design-->

  <!--Go ahead and change the title of this HTML document from "Elevator Pitch Generator" to whatever you want-->

    <h2>Busy students are often struggling to figure out when they should start an assignment. Procrastinators sometimes lose track of days until an exam when they should be studying for it. SchoolGuru will not only help students keep all of their
      assignments in once place, but will remind them when to start those assignments, or study for that test. SchoolGuru is made for students, by students, in hopes of bringing what they desire most to an accessible platform online.</h2>

    <h1>Definition</h1>

    <h2>This program will accept user input with key information for each task such as class, importance, estimated completion time, etcetera.<br><br>The student will then be able to view each class and its assignments separately, or a time table
      will be built with start and end dates for all input assignments. Students will have to put in all known assignments at once, since the site cannot track profiles or bring up data from previous sessions. However, the site will be able to email
      the student the time table for the assignments so the student can print it out.

    <h1>Quality</h1>
    <h2>We are at the question of quality: why is solving this problem important? The issue of having too many assignments to keep track over will stress students out. Most of us have been there. On top of the importance to their careers and futures,
      college can really affect the mental health of students. According to University of Pittsburgh Dean Bonner, 3 college age U.S. citizens take their own lives every day. That is why it's vital to do everything possible to help students stay
      organized and motivated to succeed. This will be a very accessible site once the word spreads about it. Anyone with the ability to access the internet will be able to use it, and print out a copy of thier assignments while staying focused on
      which ones are most important to complete now.</h2>
